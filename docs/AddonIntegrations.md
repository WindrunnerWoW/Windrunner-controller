# Addon Integrations

Windrunner-Controller integrates with several popular addons to provide a seamless experience. This document describes the supported integrations and any required configuration.

## pfUI Integration

[pfUI](https://github.com/shagu/pfUI) is a full UI replacement for Vanilla WoW and TBC. Windrunner-Controller provides automatic integration with pfUI.

### Automatic Features

When pfUI is detected, Windrunner-Controller will:

- **Automatically disable the Chat module** - pfUI has its own chat system, so Windrunner-Controller's chat module is disabled to prevent conflicts
- **Apply pfUI styling** - The Windrunner-Controller configuration frame and main menu button will automatically use pfUI's styling system for a consistent look
- **Support pfUI bag frames** - Cursor navigation works seamlessly with pfUI's custom bag frames (`pfBag` and `pfBank`)

### Required Configuration

**Important:** You must manually disable the Action Bar module in pfUI to avoid conflicts with Windrunner-Controller's action bars.

1. Open pfUI configuration with `/pfui`
2. Navigate to **Modules** → **Action Bars**
3. Disable the Action Bar module
4. Reload your UI with `/rl`

### Benefits

- Consistent UI styling across all frames
- Full cursor navigation support for pfUI's bag system
- No chat conflicts between the two addons

## Troubleshooting

### Cursor Not Appearing on Bag Frames

If the cursor doesn't appear when navigating bag frames from pfUI, Bagshui, or Bagnon:

1. Make sure both addons are enabled
2. Try reloading your UI with `/rl`
3. Open and close the bag frame once to trigger the hook
4. Check the Windrunner debug messages (if enabled) for hook status

### Conflicts with Other Addons

If you experience conflicts with other bag or UI addons:

1. Check if the addon is in the list of supported integrations
2. Try disabling other bag addons if you're using one of the supported ones
3. Report the issue on the GitHub repository with details about the conflicting addon
